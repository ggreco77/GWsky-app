Name: "GW170817 - optical background"
Date: 17/08/2017 12:41:04
Description: "On 17 August 2017, at 12:41:04 UTC the LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave detector
network registered a gravitational wave signal from the inspiral of two compact stellar
remnants known as neutron stars.
Less than two seconds after the GW170817 signal, NASA's Fermi satellite observed a gamma-ray burst,
now known as GRB170817A, and within minutes of these initial detections telescopes around the world
began an extensive observing campaign. The Swope telescope in Chile was the first to report a bright
optical source (AT2017gfo) in the galaxy NGC 4993 and several other teams independently detected the
same transient over the next minutes and hours. For the next several weeks astronomers observed this
location with instruments sensitive across the electromagnetic spectrum; these observations provide a
comprehensive view of this cataclysmic event starting ~100 seconds before merger until several weeks after.
The observations support the hypothesis that two neutron stars merged in
NGC 4993 - producing gravitational waves, a short-duration gamma-ray burst, and a kilonova.
GW170817 marks a new era of multi-messenger astronomy,
where the same event is observed by both gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves.
The new light-based observations show that heavy elements, such as lead and gold, are created 
in these collisions and subsequently distributed throughout the universe."
