Description: "On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 Greenwich Mean Time the LIGO Hanford and Livingston Observatories both detected a signal from GW150914. The results indicate that GW150914 was produced by the merger of two black holes with masses of about 36 times and 29 times the mass of the Sun respectively, and that the post-merger black hole had a mass of about 62 times the Sun's mass. If we compare the masses of the pre- and post-merger black holes, we see that the coalescence converted about three times the mass of the Sun (or nearly six million trillion trillion kilograms) into gravitational-wave energy, most of it emitted in a fraction of a second. By contrast the Sun converts a mere two billionths of one trillionth of its mass into electromagnetic radiation every second. In fact, the gravitational-wave power radiated by GW150914 was more than ten times greater than the combined luminosity (i.e. the light power) of every star and galaxy in the observable Universe. GW150914 occurred at a distance of more than one billion light years. The sky localization area is 182 square degrees."
