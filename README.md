# GWsky-an augmented reality app to locate gravitational-wave events
Gravitational-Wave events are distortions of the space-time field, which only recently have become measurable to astronomers and physicists around the world. This app will allow you to see the localization of these events over the sky.

An optical full-sky survey and an artistic-constellation image are aligned with your device's GPS and position information, allowing you to freely look around the starry skies. An arrow will direct you to the sky locations of three interesting gravitational-wave events. Once you have identified the region, hold the device for a few moments to "hear" the space-time distortion and then read a short description regarding the event discovery and characteristics.

The audio files for confident detections are taken by the Gravitational Wave Open Science Center - more information at https://www.gw-openscience.org/audiogwtc1/
GWsky provides a proper sky alignment of HIP (Hierarchical Progressive Surveys) images developed in the framework of the Virtual Observatory. That is, the same technology astronomers around the world use!
GWsky is an open and free project, contributions are welcome! The app is under testing,  please, use with caution and send suggestions/corrections to the email addresses reported in the credit.
